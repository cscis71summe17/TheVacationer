### Estimations

We did the Bucketing estimation for out PBIs by Development Team. We did a relative estimation of each story in story points based on the complexity of each story.

### Backlog prioritization

The backlog was prioritized according to the core functionalities necessary for the first sprint to create an Minimal Viable Product (taking in account risk, complexity and etc.). The core functionality was decided based on customer inputs. 


# Project Part 2 of 4

**First sprint:** 13 points estimate 

**Motivation** - We can pull couple of simple tasks and make a good progress on them and we can pull one big task. Also the infrastructure setup could be postponed.

**Sprint goal**: Initial Skeleton of product with some basic functionality that can be available in DB/server, not necessarily dynamically from side APIs (reduce uncertainty + feasibility). 

**Kanban URL**: https://trello.com/b/xn8Hnj4p/the-vacationer-project

**Daily Scrum**: Conducted on 28-Jun-2017 at 3 PM.

* Scrum master initiated the daily scrum meeting. This meeting started at 3 and completed at 3:15.

* All the team members have participated in the scrum meeting.

* We identified an issue with the communication channel. Few members were following slack to communicate and other were using Whatsapp group which has caused a bit of confusion. The team has collectively agreed that from now onwards everyone will follow Whatsapp group to avoid any miscommunications.

* The updates from each team member is given below:-

**Arun:** 
* In the last 24 hours, worked on ramp-up and data collection. 95% of the landmarks data collection is completed. 
* In the next 24 hours he will be working with Grigory as a pair programmer to develop the UI. He will also update the README document.

**Vas:**
* In the last 24 hours, worked on Sprint Burndown Charts.
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working to complete the Sprint Burndown Charts and complete the data collection of safety numbers for 5 European countries. 


**Alex:** 
* In the last 24 hours, worked on Rest API Server setups and it is completed. 
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working on JUNIT Testing for the backend code.



**Peter:** 
* In the last 24 hours, worked on database setup, schema setup, inserted the test data to test the APIs and JDBC model connectivity. All these tasks are completed.
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working on API calls along with Alex.


**Linh:** 
* In the last 24 hours, worked on landmark data collection. 
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working on completing the remaining 5% of the landmark data collection and unit testing of the front end UI.

**Grigory:** 
* In the last 24 hours, he worked on mockups of the UI, built the basic skeleton of the UI and country and city selector task. All these tasks are completed. 
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working on binding the UI with the backend.

**Impediment:**

We have identified an impediment related to the way the team is communicating. Few members are communicating in slack and few in Whatsapp group which has resulted in miscommunications and doubling up of efforts. To remove this impediment the team has collectively agreed to use Whatsapp Group going forward.
