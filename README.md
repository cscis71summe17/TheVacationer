### Estimations

We did the Bucketing estimation for out PBIs by Development Team. We did a relative estimation of each story in story points based on the complexity of each story.

### Backlog prioritization

The backlog was prioritized according to the core functionalities necessary for the first sprint to create an Minimal Viable Product (taking in account risk, complexity and etc.). The core functionality was decided based on customer inputs. 


# Project Part 2 of 4

**First sprint:** 13 points estimate 

**Motivation** - We can pull couple of simple tasks and make a good progress on them and we can pull one big task. Also the infrastructure setup could be postponed.

**Sprint goal**: Initial Skeleton of product with some basic functionality that can be available in DB/server, not necessarily dynamically from side APIs (reduce uncertainty + feasibility). 

**Kanban URL**: https://trello.com/b/xn8Hnj4p/the-vacationer-project

**Daily Scrum**: Conducted on 28-Jun-2017 at 3 PM.

* Scrum master initiated the daily scrum meeting. This meeting started at 3 and completed at 3:15.

* All the team members have participated in the scrum meeting.

* We identified an issue with the communication channel. Few members were following slack to communicate and other were using Whatsapp group which has caused a bit of confusion. The team has collectively agreed that from now onwards everyone will follow Whatsapp group to avoid any miscommunications.

* The updates from each team member is given below:-

**Arun:** 
* In the last 24 hours, worked on ramp-up and data collection. 95% of the landmarks data collection is completed. 
* In the next 24 hours he will be working with Grigory as a pair programmer to develop the UI. He will also update the README document.

**Vas:**
* In the last 24 hours, worked on Sprint Burndown Charts.
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working to complete the Sprint Burndown Charts and complete the data collection of safety numbers for 5 European countries. 


**Alex:** 
* In the last 24 hours, worked on Rest API Server setups and it is completed. 
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working on JUNIT Testing for the backend code.



**Peter:** 
* In the last 24 hours, worked on database setup, schema setup, inserted the test data to test the APIs and JDBC model connectivity. All these tasks are completed.
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working on API calls along with Alex.


**Linh:** 
* In the last 24 hours, worked on landmark data collection. 
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working on completing the remaining 5% of the landmark data collection and unit testing of the front end UI.

**Grigory:** 
* In the last 24 hours, he worked on mockups of the UI, built the basic skeleton of the UI and country and city selector task. All these tasks are completed. 
* In the next 24 hours, he will be working on binding the UI with the backend.

**Impediment:**

We have identified an impediment related to the way the team is communicating. Few members are communicating in slack and few in Whatsapp group which has resulted in miscommunications and doubling up of efforts. To remove this impediment the team has collectively agreed to use Whatsapp Group going forward.

# Project Part 3 of 4

**Second sprint:** 7 points estimate 

**Motivation** - Based on yesterday's weather forecasting pattern, we have selected our sprint backlog of 7 points. In our previous sprint, we have selected 13 points but we could deliver only 11 points with our team working quite a few extra hours till late night. Basically it was an over estimate. The team has collectively discussed and agreed that 7 points will be fair enough to deliver in this sprint. All the selected user stories are less than half of the forecast velocity.

**Sprint goal**: 

Make restaurants information available to our customers

She reviewed the working software we developed so far and suggested to add the below items to product backlog:

In this Sprint, we could deliver 6 points i.e., names & websites of the restaurants. We couldnt deliver the Restaurant Address user story. It remains in the sprint backlog and we will work on it in the next sprint.

1. Pictures of the famous landmarks

**Third sprint:** 7 points estimate


**Motivation** - Based on yesterday's weather forecasting pattern, we have selected our sprint backlog of 7 points. In our previous sprint, we calculated 7 story points and delivered 6 story points. This amount of work was a great amount for the development team and didn't overwhelm them to accomplish the all the items in the sprint backlog. As a team, we are confident that we can accomplish 7 story points in this sprint. All items in the sprint backlog are less than hald the forecast velocity.

**Sprint Review with Stakeholder Rehearsal**



Our Sprint Review went well with our Stakeholder, Marika. 
Our development team has demonstrated the product increment. Every backlog item that was completed was demonstrated. We use our Kanban Board to enable our stake holder Marika to follow along.

She was again happy to see the progress of our product. After our presentation, she was impressed to see the new features regarding restaurants and hotel information. 

Product Owner thanked Marika for attending the sprint review. He explained the purpose of the sprint review and requested her feedback.

Marika would like to add additional features to the website, so that it would display local tourist information. She also wanted to rearrange our product backlog, so nearby hotspots, pictures of famous landmarks, information on mode of transportation to the famous landmarks, opening hours of the famous landmarks, Admission fee to landmarks, and finally maps that would show the region of interest. 

All the inputs given by Marika are updated in the product backlog.


In this Sprint, we could deliver 7 points, the total amount that we estimated for this third Sprint. We were able to add Restaurants Addresses, Names of the hotel as well as their respective addresses, and finally added gratuities 
	

In the next Sprint, we will work on the following features;  
1. Nearby WiFi spots
2. Pictures of landmarks 
3. Mode of transportation to the famous landmarks 
4. Opening hours of the famous landmarks 

Scrum master was keeping track of time and provided his inputs where required.
